# Course ID: CSC3050
## Purpose
This repository aims to help student who are learning **CSC3050** or **Computer Architecture** by referring to my codes.
## WARNING
This course will use **MOSS** to check if your codes are similar to your classmates or the previous students. 
Therefore, please do not **plagiarize**, or you might get a **ZERO** mark.
## Components
This repository includes all four projects.
Besides the first project that is 99/100, I got full marks in other projectsincluding bonus part.
Please find the tiny mistake I make in the first project if you want to run my codes.
