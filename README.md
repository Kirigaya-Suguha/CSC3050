# Course ID: CSC3050
## Purpose
This repository aims to help student who are learning **CSC3050** or **Computer Architecture** by referring to my codes.
## WARNING
This course will use **MOSS** to check if your codes are similar to your classmates or the previous students.  
Therefore, please do not **plagiarize**, or you might get a **ZERO** mark.
## Components
This repository includes all four projects' requirments and codes based on **AY2021-2022** CSC3050 course.  
Besides the first project that is 99/100, I got full marks in other projects.
* MIPS Assembler (99/100)
* MIPS Simulator (100/100)
* ALU (100/100)
* pipeline CPU (with dealing with the hazard) (120/120)

Please find the tiny mistake I make in the first project if you want to run my codes.
## Advice
1. Write the codes as soon as possible.  
2. Learn **CPP** & **Verilog** in advance.  
3. For the last two projects, please find a **tool** to help you with debugging visually.  
4. Write a **makefile** for every projects.  

Hope you all get good grades in this course.  
If you find my codes useful, please **fork this repository** or **give me a star**.
